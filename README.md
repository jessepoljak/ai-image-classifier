"The dataset consists of authentic images sampled from the Shutterstock platform across various categories, including a balanced selection where one-third of the images feature humans. These authentic images are paired with their equivalents generated using state-of-the-art generative models. This structured pairing enables a direct comparison between real and AI-generated content, providing a robust foundation for developing and evaluating image authenticity detection systems." (Kaggle)
